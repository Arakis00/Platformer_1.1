This is the XNA Starter Kit expanded to have side scrolling levels.

# Notes
I downloaded the starter kit and tinkered with it in order to learn a bit more about C#/XNA for a group project.  My two groupmates said they were the most comfortable using C#, so that's what we went with.  I had no experience with it, but I'm always interested in learning the ins and outs of a new language.
